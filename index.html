  <h2>After Barchelona we pass through Tunisia and stop at Malta.</h2>
  <h3>Malta is mostly known for :</h3>
  <h4>The Great Siege of 1565 and the Knights of St. John Era:</h4>
  <p>
The Knights of St. John, a military and religious order, defended Malta against a massive Ottoman Empire invasion during the Great Siege of 1565. Despite being heavily outnumbered, the Knights, with the help of Maltese locals, repelled the siege in a dramatic and hard-fought victory.
The siege was a major turning point in European history, as it halted Ottoman expansion into the western Mediterranean. In recognition of the victory, the Knights began constructing Valletta, a fortified capital that became a symbol of European resilience and Baroque grandeur. 
This era profoundly shaped Malta’s architecture, culture, and national identity, and is still honored today through festivals, monuments, and popular media.<p>

  <h3>Malta is also known for its bravery in</h3>

  <h4>WW2:</h4>
<p>Malta was a key base for the British during WW2. It sits between Italy and North Africa, so it was very important for controlling ships and supplies in the Mediterranean.
For two years, Malta was bombed heavily by German and Italian planes — some of the worst attacks in history.
People had to live in caves and shelters underground. Food and supplies were very hard to get.
Even though the island was close to giving up, the people stayed strong and refused to surrender.
Because of their bravery, the whole Maltese people were given the George Cross by King George VI.
This is a very high award, and Malta is one of the few places to receive it.
You can still see the George Cross in the corner of Malta’s flag today.
Malta’s bravery helped the Allies (like Britain and the U.S.) win the fight for the Mediterranean.
Later, Malta was used as a base to launch attacks on Sicily and Italy, which helped lead to victory in Europe.</p>
